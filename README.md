# Allow existing URLs

This plugin will allow YOURLS to return success when presented with a URL that has already been saved and when [YOURLS_UNIQUE_URLS](https://yourls.org/docs/guide/essentials/configuration#yourls_unique_urls) is set to `true` (the default). For more context see [YOURLS#3547](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/3547).
